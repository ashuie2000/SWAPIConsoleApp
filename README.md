# Project goals


The primary objective of these projects is to showcase a profound comprehension of C#, .NET, and fundamental software development principles.

It aims to exemplify key concepts such as Separation of Concerns, Dependency Injection, and adherence to SOLID principles.



Several advanced concepts have been applied throughout the project, including:

* **Usage of DTOs:** Employing Data Transfer Objects to facilitate data exchange.

* **Diverse Class Types:** Utilizing various types of classes, including static classes and record structs, to encapsulate functionality.

* **Exception Handling:** Implementing exception handling mechanisms to gracefully manage and respond to unexpected runtime errors.

* **Reflection for Dynamic Property Handling:** Employing reflection techniques to dynamically retrieve property types and values, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

* **Asynchrony multithreading and Parallelsim:** Utilizing Asynchrony and multithreading to make apps responsive/nonblocking and potentially enhance performance.

* **Extension Methods:** Implementing extension methods to augment the functionality of existing types.

* **Object-Oriented Programming Principles:** Adhering to core OOP principles such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction to ensure a robust and scalable design.

* **Separation of Concerns:** Ensuring that each component of the system has a distinct and well-defined responsibility, contributing to maintainability and readability.

* **Code Reusability:** Emphasizing the importance of reusable code components to enhance efficiency and reduce redundancy.

Through the application of these concepts, the project attempts demonstrates technical proficiency and abilty to writing clean, modular, and extensible code in adherence to industry best practices.
